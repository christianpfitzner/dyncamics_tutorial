# dyncamics_tutorial

This is a small tutorial for a 2R robotics manipulator based on a simple Matlab/Octave implementation. 



The output of the tutorial is a plot, which shows the behaviour of two joints over time, including gravity, coriolis and mass moments. 


Here a starting angle of 0° and 0° is used, while both joints are enabled with a torque of 14 and 5 NM.
